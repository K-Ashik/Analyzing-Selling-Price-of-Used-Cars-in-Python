# Description

Now-a-days, with the technological advancement, Techniques like Machine Learning, etc are being used on a large scale in many organisations. These models usually work with a set of predefined data-points available in the form of datasets. These datasets contain the past/previous information on a specific domain. Organising these datapoints before it is fed to the model is very important. This is where we use Data Analysis. If the data fed to the machine learning model is not well organised, it gives out false or undesired output. This can cause major losses to the organisation. Hence making use of proper data analysis is very important.
